<p>The newly updated fifth edition, published for an exhibition at the Wallace Collection in Fall 2014, the <i>Founders of the Wallace Collection</i> details the fascinating history of the Hertford family.

<p> <i>The Founders</i> is a gripping historical account that provides memoirs of five generations of collectors of The Wallace Collection, offering an important resource for those interested in the formation one of the world's greatest art collections.
Detailing the rich, and at times sordid, history of the Hertford family, the book unveils how the Collection was principally formed by one of the great 19<sup>th</sup> century collectors, the 4<sup>th</sup> Marquess of Hertford.
It also discusses how other items central to the Collection were provided by his forebears, the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Marquesses, and by his illegitimate son who gave the Collection its name, Sir Richard Wallace.</p>
